        <h1>JESSALYNN FAITH OTTE</h1>
        <p >
            Hello,My name is Jessalynn Faith Otte. I have worked closely with a group of families in Uganda and I have dreamt of the day I would
            officially form a NonProfit organization that would allow me to continue to work with these families in even
            bigger ways. My DREAM came true at the begining of this year and now Imani Ministry is an Official non
            profit working to improve the futures of families in Uganda.<br><br>
            Imani means <b>"FAITH"</b>in Swahili which is the
            middle name that was given to me at birth and has impacted the way I live. God is so good! I feel so
            honored that he has chosen me to be a voice for vulnerable families in Uganda. Most of the families we work
            with are unable to provide their own families with food. When it comes to paying for a child(s) education
            they have no way of affording it. <br><br>
            Education is not free in Uganda compared to the average household income
            the price of school is outrageous. The hope of Imani Ministries is to provide the opportunity of educating
            and young adults so that their futures and the futures of their families will be impacted in a positive way.<br>
        </p>

    <div class="founder1">
        <p >
            I went to Uganda for the first time afew years ago. When I stepped off the plane I had no Idea that this
            place would be forever in my heart and life. I thought it would be something fun,new and inspiring for me
            to do. Little did I know that this place was going to be a home away from home for me. After deciding to
            move there for a year, I started sponsoring kids to go to school. Education is an essential right for
            everyone, yet this right does not come easy and isnt possible for many kids in Uganda. There is no such
            thing as public schooling for kids in Uganda, much different than the opportunities for education kids and
            adults have in the states. This opportunity to gain an education can be taken for granted by many
            Americans. Ugandans, however, see getting an education as their main ticket out of powerty. We are so
            incredibly lucky to be here in the states where we have the opportunity to go to school for free if we
            choose to go to a public school.<br><br>
            For families in Uganda, this is not as simple. If you do not have money-
            you do not go to school. School is expensive and many families are left with no other choice than to keep
            their kids at home,Our hope through Imani ministries is that we can help beat the odds these kids have been
            given. One statistic that will forever stick in my head is that "Only 1 out of evry 4 high school aged kids
            START school" The percentage of Students that finish high school is even less. In 2025 we had our
            first student graduate from COLLEGE!. We also have 4 students in their last year in high school and 4 other
            students that are in High School. <br><br>
            In order to continue their education we need donations. Whether that be
            one time donations or donations given monthly, quarterly,or yearly I am requesting your help to further the
            education of these students and even more children in the upcoming years.In addition to providing school
            fess, Imani ministry provides financial aid for medical needs, housing needs, nutrition needs, and
            businsesss opportunities. <br><br>
            I want to genuinely thank all of you that have been on this journey with me. So
            much has happened in the last years but one thing has remained the same, God's goodness. God has made
            a way when ther seemed to be no way, I feel so blessed to be close for this "job". I also ask that you will
            pray or continue to pray for me as I learn how to run a nonprofit and all that comes with it. I have faced
            my share of obstacles but through every step God has been there guiding me. I ask for prayers of peace when
            it comes to fundraising. Please pray that God uses my hands and feet to glorify His Kingdom through the
            works of Imani Ministries.
